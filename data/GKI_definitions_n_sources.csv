Key indicator,Human Development Index (HDI),"United Nations Development Programme, Human Development Data","The HDI was created to emphasize that people and their capabilities should be the ultimate criteria for assessing the development of a country, not economic growth alone. The HDI is a summary measure of average achievement in key dimensions of human development: a long and healthy life, being knowledgeable and have a decent standard of living. The HDI is the geometric mean of normalized indices for each of the three dimensions. The health dimension is assessed by life expectancy at birth, the education dimension is measured by mean of years of schooling for adults aged 25 years and more and expected years of schooling for children of school entering age. The standard of living dimension is measured by gross national income per capita. The HDI uses the logarithm of income, to reflect the diminishing importance of income with increasing GNI. The scores for the three HDI dimension indices are then aggregated into a composite index using geometric mean."

Economy,"Total tax and contribution rate (% of profit)","World Bank, Doing Business Database","The total tax rate measures the amount of taxes and mandatory contributions borne by a business in the second year of operation, expressed as a share of commercial profit. Doing Business 2017 reports the total tax rate for calendar year 2015. The total amount of taxes borne is the sum of all the different taxes and contributions payable after accounting for allowable deductions and exemptions. The taxes withheld (such as personal income tax) or collected by the company and remitted to the tax authorities (such as VAT, sales tax or goods and service tax) but not borne by the company are excluded. The taxes included can be divided into five categories: profit or corporate income tax; social contributions and labour taxes paid by the employer (for which all mandatory contributions are included, even if paid to a private entity such as a requited pension fund); property taxes; turnover taxes; and other taxes (such as municipal fees and vehicle taxes). The total tax rate is designed to provide a comprehensive measure of the cost of all the taxes a business bears. It differs from the statutory tax rate, which merely provides the factor to be applied to the tax base. In computing the total tax rate, the actual tax payable is divided by commercial profit. Commercial profit is essentially net profit before all taxes borne. It differs from the conventional profit before tax reported in financial statements. In computing profit before tax, many of the taxes borne by a firm are deductible. In computing commercial profit, these taxes are not deductible. Commercial profit therefore presents a clear picture of the actual profit of a business before any of the taxes it bears in the course of the fiscal year. Commercial profit is computed as sales minus cost of goods sold, minus gross salaries, minus administrative expenses, minus other expenses, minus provisions, plus capital gains (from the sale of property) minus interest expense, plus interest income and minus commercial depreciation."
